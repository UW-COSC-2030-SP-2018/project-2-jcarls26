Project 2

References:
I used Geeksforgeeks as a source for most of my functions including quicksort, binarysearch, and mergesort. For the Hash function I used part of hashing lab that Rafer gave us to help me figure out how to make my own hash. Finally, for the bloom filter, I used the source that we were provided (blog.michaelschmatz....) and also stackexchange to help me. 

Note:
I was able to get all of my functions to work correctly. I used type int, and vectors throughout this project. For BinarySearch, I used a pre-condition that I would not have any duplicate values in my vector.
